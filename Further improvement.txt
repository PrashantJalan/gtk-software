Improvements in programs -

1)  Read direct integers and display error if something wrong is entered. ( http://www.gtkforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=4993 )

2)  Try animation using time delay. (use sensitive followed by hidden followed by shift)

3)  Give arrows between the boxes.

4)  Make a separate box/column and write a note about it
